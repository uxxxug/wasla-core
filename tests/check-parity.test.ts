/**
 * Every `CHECK` constraint in the schema, probed against both backends (B-12).
 *
 * The uniqueness cycle closed the same gap for uniqueness rules and left this
 * one open: the schema declares a hundred `CHECK` constraints, and until this
 * cycle the reference store restated thirty-one of them. The other sixty-nine
 * were enforced by Postgres alone, so a dual-backend test could store a status
 * no reader understands, a currency that is not a currency, a claim token with
 * no claim, or a delivered notification with no delivery time — and pass. A
 * green in-memory run then certified rows production would have refused, which
 * is exactly the defect B-12 names.
 *
 * Each case takes a row the live schema accepts, breaks **one** field, and
 * asserts two things on both backends:
 *
 *   1. **The write is refused.** Acceptance by either backend fails the case.
 *   2. **The refusal names the constraint.** Not merely "invalid": the schema's
 *      own name, so a reference-store stack trace and a production stack trace
 *      read the same, and a store cannot pass by refusing the row for an
 *      unrelated reason.
 *
 * Where breaking one field unavoidably breaks a second constraint that reads it
 * — an unknown `fulfillment.status` also falsifies the coupling between status
 * and settlement state — the case lists that constraint in `alsoViolates` and
 * either name is accepted. Postgres does not promise which of two violated
 * constraints it reports, so demanding one would be asserting an implementation
 * detail rather than the rule.
 *
 * Twelve constraints are recorded as unprobeable rather than probed, each with
 * the reason: no port lets a caller name the value, so no test can construct the
 * violating row through the ports the application uses. They are listed in
 * `UNPROBEABLE`, the coverage gate counts them, and the ones whose columns exist
 * in the reference rows are still declared in `ROW_RULES` — enforced on every
 * internal transition even though a caller cannot reach them.
 *
 * The gate on the file is `covers every check constraint the live schema
 * declares`: it reads `pg_constraint` and fails when a `CHECK` has neither a
 * case nor a recorded reason. A migration adding one cannot ship without
 * measuring parity for it.
