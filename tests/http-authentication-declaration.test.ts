/**
 * Every route declares whether it needs a credential, the router enforces that
 * declaration before it reads anything else, and `401` is published wherever it
 * can happen — milestone 30.
 *
 * What was measured on the reservation commit, by sweeping all 52 registrations
 * over the router with no `authorization` header and a syntactically valid but
 * invented identifier in every path parameter:
 *
 *  - **200 × 3** — `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`. Intended.
 *  - **400 × 28** — twenty-eight routes parsed an anonymous caller's query
 *    string or body and told it what was wrong with them. Authentication lived
 *    inside each handler, so the parse always ran first and the caller learned
 *    which properties the route accepts, which are required, and which it
 *    misspelled, before CORE ever asked who it was.
 *  - **401 × 19**, **404 × 2**.
 *  - The two 404s are the sharp one. `GET /v1/fulfillments/{id}` answered **404
 *    for an invented identifier and 401 for a real one**, to the same anonymous
 *    caller. That difference is an existence oracle: anyone could test whether a
 *    fulfillment id exists without holding any credential at all.
 *  - **3 of 52 operations documented `401`** in `contracts/openapi/core-v1.yaml`,
 *    while 46 of them can answer it.
 *
 * What changed. Authentication became a property of the route rather than a
 * line inside a handler: `AuthenticationSpec` is `AUTHENTICATED` or
 * `anonymous(reason)`, every registration carries one, and `Router.handle`
 * resolves it after the rate limiter and before `parseSelection`, `parseBody`
 * and the handler. `bearerCredential` in `src/platform/http/authentication.ts`
 * is now the only reader of the `authorization` header in the repository, and
 * no handler calls `authenticate` at all.
 *
 * After: **200 × 3, 400 × 3, 401 × 46** — the three 400s being the three
 * anonymous-by-declaration write routes refusing an empty body, which is the
 * answer they should give. Real and invented identifiers are indistinguishable
 * to an anonymous caller everywhere.
 *
 * This reverses the ordering milestones 24 and 25 chose, deliberately; the
 * record is in `docs/authentication-ordering.md` and in the two cases those
 * milestones' gates now carry. Their stated reason — "a request CORE cannot
 * understand must not reach a store, and authentication is a store read" —
 * still holds: a request with no bearer header is refused before any session is
 * read, and a junk credential costs one indexed read that the rate limiter,
 * which still runs first, already bounds. `rate-limit.test.ts` owns that
 * ordering ("attributes an unauthenticated flood to the network").
 *
 * What this file does not claim: that authorization is right. Who may do what
 * is `identity.authorize`, and B-39 and B-40 are still open — `POST
 * /v1/sessions` will mint a token for any principal id, so "authenticated" is
 * today a weaker statement than it reads. Those are recorded, gated by
 * `anonymous-privilege-escalation.test.ts`, and not touched here.
 *
 * No database: memory backend, so this gate runs in both CI jobs.
