/**
 * Read-path parity: what a store *returns*, not only what it accepts.
 *
 * Six parity cycles gate writes. `putRow` refuses a row Postgres would refuse,
 * column by column, check by check, key by key. Nothing gated reads, and three
 * of the last three cycles found the same defect for the same reason:
 *
 *   - `outbox.created_at` — inserted by the Postgres adapter, selected by
 *     neither, absent from the reference record (milestone 18).
 *   - `inbound_event.processed_at` — the same shape, same cycle.
 *   - `rate_limit_counter.updated_at` — written by the database's own `now()`
 *     on one backend and by the injected clock on the other (milestone 19).
 *
 * Each was invisible to the whole suite because a column that one backend
 * writes and no read returns is a difference nothing can observe. Two of them
 * were closed by adding a name to a `SELECT_COLUMNS` string, and nothing kept
 * those strings complete — which is the gap this file closes.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately different in kind:
 *
 *   1. **Static.** Every `select` and `returning` in the Postgres adapters is
 *      parsed, the column-list constants are expanded, and the result is
 *      compared with `COLUMN_SHAPES`. A column the schema has and no read
 *      surfaces must be declared, by name, with a reason. A declaration for a
 *      column that *is* read fails, so the list cannot rot into a permanent
 *      excuse. A name read that the schema does not have fails as well, which
 *      is also what keeps the parser honest: a mis-parse produces ghosts.
 *   2. **Behavioural.** For the four stores that return records, a row is
 *      written and read back through *both* backends and the two records are
 *      compared key for key. This is the gate that would have caught all three
 *      historical divergences on the day they were introduced, and it does not
 *      depend on reading SQL at all.
 *
 * The static half cannot prove a read is *correct*; it proves no column is
 * unreachable. The behavioural half cannot see a column no record carries; it
 * proves the two backends answer alike. Neither subsumes the other, and the
 * three known divergences needed both to be closed and kept closed.
