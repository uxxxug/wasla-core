/**
 * Reads `contracts/openapi/core-v1.yaml` as data, and checks a value against a
 * schema taken out of it.
 *
 * Why this exists at all, and why it is not a dependency
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * Milestones 24, 25 and 26 gated what a route *reads* from a request, and each
 * of those gates could compare code against the contract by scanning its text:
 * "does this parameter appear", "is this component referenced". What a route
 * *answers* cannot be checked that way. A response is a value, and the question
 * is whether that value satisfies the shape the contract publishes, so the
 * contract has to be parsed into something a check can walk.
 *
 * The repository has no YAML dependency and adding one would put a third party
 * between CORE and the file MOVE and MARKET build against, so this reads the
 * subset the contract actually uses:
 *
 *  - block mappings and block sequences, by indentation;
 *  - flow mappings and flow sequences on one line — `{ type: string }`,
 *    `[a, b]` — which is how most of this contract is written;
 *  - folded and literal scalars (`>`, `>-`, `|`, `|-`), which the descriptions
 *    use heavily;
 *  - quoted and bare scalars, booleans and numbers.
 *
 * It deliberately does **not** support anchors, aliases, multiple documents,
 * tags or nested flow collections, and it throws on a line it cannot account
 * for rather than skipping it. A parser that silently ignores what it does not
 * understand would let a response schema disappear from the contract without
 * the gate noticing, which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
