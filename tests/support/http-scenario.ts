/**
 * One run of the whole HTTP surface, kept as data.
 *
 * The response gate needs a **real** answer from every operation the contract
 * publishes, because the question it asks — does what CORE returns satisfy what
 * the contract says it returns — cannot be answered from a fixture written to
 * match the contract. So this drives the routes the way a client would: over
 * `router.handle`, with a bearer token, in the order the state requires, each
 * response kept under the contract's own label for the operation.
 *
 * Two rules this file follows, both learned from the parity cycles:
 *
 *  - **Every route is driven, not a chosen subset.** The gate asserts that the
 *    set of labels here equals the set of operations in the contract, so a route
 *    added later cannot quietly go unchecked, and a route removed from here
 *    cannot quietly stop being measured.
 *  - **Every call is kept as the request that produced it**, not only as the
 *    answer it got: milestone 32's retry gate re-issues each write route's own
 *    request a second time, byte-identically, and asks whether anything was
 *    created twice. A gate that re-built those requests from a list of its own
 *    would be measuring a list, and would go stale the moment a route changed
 *    what it accepts.
 *  - **State comes from CORE's own routes wherever a route can make it.** Rows
 *    are seeded through the stores only where no HTTP route creates them at all:
 *    a fulfillment is created by ingesting a market order, a reputation signal by
 *    ingesting a review, and a delivery by the outbound worker. Seeding what a
 *    route could have created would let the gate pass against a response CORE
 *    never actually produces.
