/**
 * A write route survives being called twice — and says how — milestone 32.
 *
 * What was measured on `main` at `bd92b69`, before any edit, by re-issuing each
 * of the 29 write routes' own recorded request a second time, byte-identical,
 * against the state the response gate's scenario left, and counting the rows of
 * all 25 business tables the reference registry holds around each one:
 *
 *  - `POST /v1/organizations` → **201**, `organization` 2 → 3. Two
 *    organizations may share a name and a country, so nothing any later read
 *    can ask distinguishes the duplicate from the original.
 *  - `POST /v1/geography/cities` → **201**, `city` 1 → 2, while
 *    `POST /v1/geography/regions` beside it, in the same module, deduplicated
 *    on `(country_code, code)`. The clearest evidence available that retry
 *    safety was an accident of each handler rather than a property of the
 *    surface.
 *  - `POST /v1/geography/service-areas` → **201**, `service_area` 1 → 2: two
 *    areas over the same ground, and every serviceability read matching both.
 *  - `POST /v1/subscriptions` → **201**, and five tables grew:
 *    `subscription` 1 → 2, `subscription_period` 1 → 2,
 *    `payment_authorization` 5 → 6, `ledger_transaction` 6 → 7, `outbox`
 *    26 → 30. A duplicate is a second recurring charge against the same
 *    wallet.
 *  - `POST /v1/sessions` → **201**, `session` 3 → 4, which is correct: two
 *    calls for a session are two sessions.
 *  - `/v1/memberships`, `/v1/plans` and `/v1/plans/{plan_id}/activate` refused
 *    the repeat with **409**. Every other write route collapsed it, by one of
 *    four mechanisms nothing named as a policy: a natural-key upsert
 *    (`/v1/identities`, `/v1/wallets`, `…/usage` answer `200` the second
 *    time), a caller-supplied reference (`/v1/payment-authorizations`,
 *    `/v1/events`), a uniqueness constraint (`/v1/event-subscriptions`), or a
 *    state transition that is a no-op once it has happened.
 *  - No route read an `Idempotency-Key` header. Sending one changed nothing,
 *    because milestone 14's header declaration means an undeclared header is
 *    never read at all. The `idempotency_key` table from migration 0001 had
 *    never held a row, and had no column for the request or the status.
 *
 * One thing the reservation expected and the measurement did not find:
 * `POST /v1/geography/countries` did **not** write a second row. The country's
 * primary key is the code the caller sends and the repository upserts it, so
 * the repeat answered `201` again and overwrote the existing row. It is
 * declared `keyed` all the same — an upsert on a caller-supplied key hides the
 * repeat by letting whichever call arrives second decide the country's name and
 * default currency, and a caller retrying a call it never saw the answer to
 * cannot tell that from having been first.
 *
 * What changed. Retry safety is a property of the registration, the way
 * `accepts` (milestone 25), `body` (26), `authentication` (30) and entitlement
 * (31) already are: every route declares one of three mechanisms with a reason,
 * the default for a write is `keyed` so a forgotten declaration fails closed,
 * and the router enforces the one mechanism a handler cannot provide for
 * itself. For a `keyed` route it reads the caller's `Idempotency-Key`, refuses
 * a request without one, fingerprints method + route template + canonical JSON
 * of the parsed body, replays a recorded answer for an identical request and
 * refuses a key reused for a different one.
 *
 * What this file asserts, and in which order: that every registration carries a
 * declaration and every `keyed` one is published in the contract; that a repeat
 * of **every** write route creates nothing, except where the declaration says a
 * repeat must create something; and then, against both persistence backends,
 * the nine behaviours the mechanism consists of.
 *
 * What this file does not claim.
 *
 *  - **That a `keyed` route is safe against a concurrent retry.** The record is
 *    written after the handler answered, so two identical requests in flight at
 *    the same instant can both reach the handler. Closing that needs the record
 *    claimed before the work, inside the handler's own transaction — a
 *    different design and a different cycle. The bound is stated in
 *    `src/platform/http/retry.ts` rather than implied away here.
 *  - **That a `natural` reason is true for the reason it gives.** The repeat
 *    case below proves a repeat creates no row; it cannot prove *which*
 *    mechanism collapsed it. A route whose upsert was replaced by a silent
 *    swallow would still pass, and the reason string is what a reviewer reads.
 *  - **That a replay is byte-identical on the wire.** It is the same JSON
 *    document, asserted key for key and value for value through the same
 *    canonicaliser the fingerprint uses. It is not the same bytes on Postgres,
 *    where `jsonb` stores a parsed document and orders the keys itself — a
 *    difference measured here rather than assumed away, and named in
 *    `docs/retry-idempotency.md`.
 *  - **That the five keyed routes replay their response headers.** A replay
 *    restores the status and the body only. None of the five sets a header of
 *    its own, so there is nothing to lose today; a route that started to would
 *    need this decision revisited, which is why it is written down in
 *    `docs/retry-idempotency.md` as well.
