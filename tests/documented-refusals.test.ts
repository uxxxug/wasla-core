/**
 * A route documents every refusal it can actually produce — milestone 36.
 *
 * The answer surface has been gated from the contract *outwards* since milestone
 * 27: every documented status must be produced, every produced body must satisfy
 * its documented schema (27), every response must declare the headers it sets
 * (28), and `401` must be documented wherever it can happen (30). Nothing gated
 * the other direction — **a status a route can answer that the contract never
 * mentions**. A caller generating a client from this file would have no branch
 * for it.
 *
 * Measured on `main` at `2390649` before anything was edited, by driving all 52
 * registrations twice with a credential (once with a body naming a field no
 * route declares, once with no body at all):
 *
 *  - **33 of 52 operations answered a refusal they do not document.** All 33
 *    answered an undocumented `400`, including `GET /health`, `GET /ready` and
 *    `GET /metrics`, which documented only `200`.
 *  - Two also answered an undocumented `404`:
 *    `POST /v1/fulfillments/{fulfillment_id}/cancel` and
 *    `GET /v1/geography/regions/{region_id}/cities`.
 *
 * **The decision the reservation left open, and why.** Those three probe routes
 * refuse a request carrying a body they do not read, which is milestone 25's
 * boundary rule applied uniformly. The alternative was to exempt them so a
 * liveness check cannot be made to refuse by a stray body. That was rejected:
 * an exception in a uniform boundary rule is three more branches in the router
 * and a rule with a hole in it, to remove a refusal a correct caller never
 * triggers. The refusal is real, deliberate and now documented — and documented
 * against `UnlimitedError`, not the shared `Error`, because these routes send no
 * `x-ratelimit-*` headers and milestone 28's gate compares documented headers
 * against real ones.
 *
 * What this file asserts:
 *
 *  1. **Every refusal produced by the matrix below is documented** for the
 *     operation that produced it. This is the guarantee.
 *  2. **Coverage**: the operations driven are exactly the operations the
 *     contract publishes, so a route added later cannot go unmeasured.
 *  3. **Every refusal produced is the documented refusal shape**, so the new
 *     entries are not a status code with no schema behind it.
 *  4. **The documented refusal declares the headers that refusal carries**,
 *     derived from `rateClassFor` rather than from a second list: the
 *     correlation header always, the three budget headers exactly when the route
 *     has a rate class. This is what makes `UnlimitedError` load-bearing instead
 *     of decorative — pointing `/health`'s new `400` at the shared `Error` would
 *     publish three headers CORE does not send there, and milestone 28's gate
 *     would not notice, because it checks the status each operation returns on a
 *     successful call and `400` is not that status.
 *  5. **429 is documented by exactly the routes that can produce one**, decided
 *     per rate class against a real budget rather than per route: a
 *     representative of each limited class is driven past its limit and must
 *     answer 429, and the three `UNLIMITED_ROUTES` are driven far past every
 *     budget and must never answer one.
 *
 * The matrix is deliberately shallow and uniform — anonymous, a body no route
 * declares, no body, an unknown path parameter, a keyed route with no key. It
 * reaches `400`, `401`, `403` and `404`. It does **not** reach `409` or `500`,
 * and this gate therefore makes no claim about them; the routes that document
 * those are covered by their own milestones' tests. Stated here rather than
 * implied, because a whole-surface sweep reads as a stronger claim than it is —
 * the lesson recorded in milestone 34, where the sweep held vacuously. The
 * status set the matrix reaches is asserted rather than described, so widening
 * it later is a decision somebody makes on purpose.
 *
 * No database: the memory backend, so this runs in both CI jobs.
