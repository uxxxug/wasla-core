/**
 * Every write route accepts only the body it declares — milestone 25.
 *
 * Milestone 24 closed the query string and said in its own record that the body
 * was the other half and was still open. Measuring it before reserving this
 * milestone turned that from a symmetry argument into a money defect:
 *
 *   POST /v1/payment-authorizations/<id>/capture  {"amountMinor": 500, ...}
 *   → 200, captured 5000
 *
 * An absent `amount_minor` means "capture the whole remaining hold", which is the
 * right meaning for absence, so one camelCase spelling took ten times what the
 * caller asked for and the response said success. `refund` has the same shape.
 * `POST /v1/wallets` accepted `nonsense` and `CURRENCY` beside `currency` and
 * answered 201. Every write route hand-parsed `ctx.body as Record<string,
 * unknown>` with helpers duplicated across seven files, and not one refused a
 * property it did not read.
 *
 * The fix is structural, as in milestone 24: `router.post` takes what the route
 * accepts as its second argument, the router parses the body before the handler
 * runs, and `RequestContext` carries **no raw body at all** — only the parsed
 * `Body`. So a handler cannot read an undeclared property and an undeclared
 * property cannot reach a handler.
 *
 * This file is the gate on that structure, driven off `router.registrations()`
 * rather than a list maintained here:
 *
 *  1. **Every write route refuses an unknown property**, 400, naming it — before
 *     authentication, so the refusal cannot be confused with a permission answer.
 *  2. **A route that declares no body refuses every property**, and still accepts
 *     an absent body and `{}`, which ask for nothing.
 *  3. **Every declared field is live**: a wrong-typed value for it is refused by
 *     name, which is only true if the declaration is what the parse reads.
 *  4. **Declared and read agree**: a field declared and never read is a name the
 *     route advertises and ignores, the same lie from the other end.
 *  5. **The declarations are well formed**, and the one opaque body is the event
 *     envelope, named here so a second cannot appear quietly.
 *  6. **No handler reads a body any other way**: `ctx.body` is gone and the
 *     hand-rolled readers are deleted, measured in the source.
 *  7. **The contract agrees**: every documented request-body property is declared
 *     and every declared property is documented.
 *  8. **The capture and refund defects are refused**, by their real request shapes.
 *
 * No database: none of this depends on a store, so it runs in both CI jobs.
