/**
 * Every documented conflict has a producer, and every producer is documented.
 *
 * Milestone 36 built the response gate and named the two statuses its matrix
 * does not reach: `409` and `500`. Milestone 37 closed `500` by replaying the
 * scenario against a persistence that throws. This file closes `409`, and it
 * cannot be done the same way, because a conflict is not a broken backend — it
 * is a business fact that has to be *made* before the route will refuse.
 *
 * Two rules this file follows, both of them learned the hard way in cycle 39's
 * own measurement:
 *
 *  - **A driver must change the business fact, not repeat the request.** The
 *    first probe of this cycle re-sent each recorded request with a fresh
 *    idempotency key and an identical body, and read `2xx` on 14 of the 17
 *    documented conflicts — which looked like "11 documented conflicts are
 *    unreachable" and was wrong. An identical body exercises the natural-key and
 *    idempotency path. `POST .../capture` really does answer `409` when the
 *    second capture asks for money the hold no longer has.
 *  - **The mechanism is declared, not discovered.** Each driver says whether it
 *    reaches the conflict through a domain rule or through the platform's
 *    key-reuse refusal, and the census of mechanisms is asserted exactly. Three
 *    keyed creates have no domain conflict at all — `POST /v1/geography/countries`
 *    upserts, by a decision recorded in its own route — so their documented `409`
 *    is only reachable by a caller reusing a key with a different request. That is
 *    a fact about the contract, and it is written down here rather than hidden
 *    inside a helper that tries mechanisms until one works.
 *
 * Setup runs over HTTP wherever a route can make the state. Two places it
 * cannot: closing a fulfillment other than by cancelling it needs a
 * `move.job.completed` event from MARKET's own service token, and expiring a
 * subscription needs the renewal sweep, which no route exposes. Both are driven
 * through the service, and the refusal being measured is still taken over
 * `router.handle`.
