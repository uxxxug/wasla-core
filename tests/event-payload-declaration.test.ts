/**
 * Every emitted event payload conforms to its published schema — milestone 40.
 *
 * The contract gate (scripts/check-contracts.mjs) proves every event type CORE
 * emits has a published schema. It has never read a payload. The
 * fulfillment-lifecycle-contract test validates the five fulfillment event
 * payloads against their schemas, and nothing validates the other fourteen.
 * A correct answer with no enforcement is a coincidence, not a guarantee.
 *
 * This gate drives every core event type CORE can produce, reads the emitted
 * payloads from the outbox, and asserts each one satisfies its published
 * contract: every required field present, no undeclared field, and every
 * present field's type matches the declaration. No database: every event is
 * produced over the in-memory backend, since the question is about the
 * producer's contract, not the store's.
 *
 * Falsification, each applied to a conformed payload and restored: a required
 * field removed, an undeclared field added, and a field's type changed. The
 * validation function is the same one the gate uses, so a mutation that
 * survives is a gate that measures the wrong thing.
