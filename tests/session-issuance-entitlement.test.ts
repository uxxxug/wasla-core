/**
 * A session is issued only by a caller entitled to issue one, and ended only by
 * a caller entitled to end it — milestone 31, closing B-39 and B-40 and a third
 * defect the measurement found on the same route.
 *
 * What was measured on `main` at `b63585d`, before any edit, against the real
 * router, with a victim tenant whose administrator holds `platform_admin` (14
 * permissions) and a live session:
 *
 *  - `POST /v1/sessions` with **no credential** and the administrator's
 *    `principal_id` → **201** with a working `access_token`; that token read
 *    `GET /v1/sessions/current` as `platform_admin` with 14 permissions. A
 *    principal id is not a secret — it is returned by that same route, by every
 *    membership answer and by audit reads — so anybody who had seen one could
 *    become it. **B-39.**
 *  - The same call with an **outsider's own valid token** (a principal with a
 *    session and no membership anywhere) → **201** for the administrator's
 *    principal. Holding a credential was neither required nor helpful.
 *  - `POST /v1/sessions/revoke` with **no credential** and the administrator's
 *    `session_id` → **204**, and the administrator's next request → `401 session
 *    expired or revoked`. Anybody who had seen a session id could end anybody's
 *    session. **B-40.**
 *  - The same route with a **well-formed `session_id` that does not exist** →
 *    **204 and then the process terminated** with an unhandled rejection
 *    (`session not found`), because the handler called `identity.revokeSession`
 *    **without `await`**: the rejection escaped the router's error handling
 *    entirely, so the caller was told a revocation succeeded that never
 *    happened, and an unauthenticated request was a remote kill. Not previously
 *    recorded anywhere.
 *  - Contract: `POST /v1/sessions` documented `201`, `404`, `429`;
 *    `POST /v1/sessions/revoke` documented `204`, `429`. Neither documented
 *    `401` or `403` — consistent with neither refusing anyone. `/v1/sessions`
 *    also carried `security: []`, while `/v1/sessions/revoke` did **not**: the
 *    contract already said revocation needed a credential and the router did not
 *    require one. The contract was right and the code was wrong.
 *
 * What changed. `session.issue` is a permission, held by `platform_admin` and by
 * `service` — a channel adapter authenticates a person the way its own channel
 * already does, then asks CORE for a session on their behalf — and by nothing
 * else. It is deliberately not implied by `identity.write`: editing an
 * identity's name and being able to become it are different powers. Both session
 * routes declare `AUTHENTICATED`. Revocation allows the caller's own session with
 * no permission at all, and anyone else's only with `identity.write`, checked
 * **before** the "does this session exist" refusal so an unprivileged caller
 * cannot tell a real session id from an invented one — the existence oracle
 * milestone 30 removed from the fulfillment reads must not reappear here as the
 * price of closing B-40. The revocation is awaited.
 *
 * The first credential of an environment cannot come from a route that requires
 * one, so it comes from `npm run bootstrap:credential`
 * (`src/platform/bootstrap/`), which needs `DATABASE_URL`. That is the security
 * argument: anybody who can run it can already read every row and write every
 * table, while the route it replaces needed only the ability to send a request.
 *
 * What this file does not claim. That `session.issue` is *scoped*: a service
 * credential may mint a session for any principal, not only for the people its
 * own channel speaks for. That is **B-42**, recorded rather than half-answered,
 * and it is a strictly smaller hole than the one closed here — it needs a
 * credential CORE issued to a named system, and every issuance is audited as
 * `session.issued` against the issuing principal.
 *
 * No database: memory backend, so this gate runs in both CI jobs.
