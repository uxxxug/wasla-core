/**
 * Every `FOREIGN KEY` in the schema, probed against both backends (B-12).
 *
 * The uniqueness cycle closed 24 rules of one kind and the check-constraint
 * cycle 100 of another. This closes the third family: the schema declares 30
 * foreign keys, and before this cycle exactly one of them was restated in
 * `src/`. The other 29 were enforced by Postgres alone, so a dual-backend test
 * could store a fulfillment in no tenant, a membership for no principal, a
 * session for no principal, a notification addressed to a recipient row that
 * was never created, or a delivery of an envelope the outbox never recorded —
 * and pass on the reference half. A green in-memory run then certified rows
 * production refuses, which is the defect B-12 names.
 *
 * Each case writes a row that is valid in every other respect and names a
 * parent that does not exist, then asserts two things on both backends:
 *
 *   1. **The write is refused.** Acceptance by either backend fails the case.
 *   2. **The refusal names the constraint**, so a reference-store stack trace
 *      and a production one read the same and a store cannot pass by refusing
 *      the row for an unrelated reason.
 *
 * One key is recorded as exempt rather than probed:
 * `ledger_entry_transaction_id_fkey`. Entries are not a row table of their own
 * in the reference backend — `insertTransaction` takes the header with its
 * entries nested inside it — so there is no map to declare a rule against and
 * no entry a caller could point at a different transaction. Postgres keeps
 * enforcing it; the exemption and its reason are recorded in `UNPROBEABLE` and
 * the coverage gates treat that list, and only that list, as an excuse.
 *
 * Four gates hold the file honest, and the first two are the ones that make the
 * declaration self-checking rather than a second opinion:
 *
 *   - `covers every foreign key the live schema declares` reads `pg_constraint`
 *     and fails when a key has neither a case nor a recorded reason.
 *   - `declares each key exactly as the schema does` reads the child column,
 *     the parent table and the column's nullability out of the catalog and
 *     compares them with `FOREIGN_KEYS`. A migration that repoints a key, or
 *     drops a `NOT NULL`, fails here instead of quietly disabling a check.
 *   - `resolves every parent table` asserts the reference bundle registered a
 *     source for every parent a rule reads. This is the one weakening in the
 *     design — an unregistered parent is a key that cannot be evaluated — and
 *     it is measured rather than trusted.
 *   - `records a reason for every unprobeable key`.
