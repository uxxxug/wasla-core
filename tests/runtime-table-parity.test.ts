/**
 * The tables the parity work never reached (milestone 19).
 *
 * Five parity cycles and a column cycle all measured the same 28 tables,
 * because those are the tables with a `ROW_RULES` entry — and the reason they
 * have one is that somebody wrote one. The cycle that closed column parity said
 * the four tables outside that set are "migration bookkeeping, written by the
 * migration runner rather than by a store". Re-measuring found that wrong, and
 * this file is what stops the same claim being made again:
 *
 * - `inbox` is written on every consumer claim (ADR 0009). Its `event_id` is a
 *   `uuid` column; the reference store kept a `Set` of composed strings, so
 *   `claim(consumer, "not-a-uuid")` was accepted in memory and refused by
 *   Postgres.
 * - `rate_limit_counter` is written on every request. It carries **three**
 *   `CHECK` constraints, all three of which were recorded in
 *   `tests/check-parity.test.ts` as unprobeable *because the reference limiter
 *   held no row*.
 * - `idempotency_key` is written by nothing at all.
 * - `schema_migrations` is the one table the original sentence described.
 *
 * The first two are rows now, and gated like the other 28. The last two are
 * exemptions — and an exemption in this repository is a claim a test tries to
 * break, not a sentence in a document, so both are asserted here.
