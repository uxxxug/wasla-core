/**
 * The full lifecycle of migration 0011 against a real PostgreSQL server.
 *
 * 0011 widened two check constraints so a fulfillment can record
 * `partially_captured`, and its rollback deliberately **refuses** while any row
 * holds that value: narrowing the list back leaves no honest value for such a
 * row — `released` would claim no money moved and `captured` would claim all of
 * it did. That refusal is the safety property, so it is tested rather than
 * described, in both directions: it must refuse when such a row exists and it
 * must succeed when none does.
 *
 * Everything runs in a throwaway database created and dropped by this suite. It
 * applies and rolls back real DDL, so sharing the development database with the
 * rest of the suite would make the two interfere.
