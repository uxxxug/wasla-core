/**
 * Selection parity for the module read paths — milestone 22.
 *
 * Milestone 21 asked one question of the three eventing queues: do the two
 * backends pick the same rows, in the same order, for the same call? It found
 * that the reference queues did not sort at all. This file asks the same
 * question of everything else that returns a list — notifications, money,
 * subscriptions, identities, memberships, organizations, fulfillments — and
 * the answer had the same shape: the Postgres repositories sort, the reference
 * repositories returned insertion order, and the two agreed only because the
 * fixtures happened to insert rows in the order the SQL would have sorted them
 * into.
 *
 * So the population here is built **deliberately out of order**: every batch is
 * inserted newest-first, or in reverse code order, and several rows share a
 * timestamp so the tiebreak is exercised too. A store that returns insertion
 * order now returns the reverse of the right answer, and a sort key that is not
 * total now has a tie to get wrong.
 *
 * Three properties, the same ones milestone 21 settled on:
 *
 *  1. Each case declares how many rows it expects, asserted against the
 *     reference backend **without a database**, so a case that silently
 *     selects nothing fails instead of passing vacuously.
 *  2. Representative cases also declare the order they must return, computed
 *     from the fixture definitions rather than read back out of a store, so
 *     "both backends agree" cannot mean "both are wrong in the same way".
 *  3. A premise test proves the two backends hold the same population before
 *     any selection runs.
