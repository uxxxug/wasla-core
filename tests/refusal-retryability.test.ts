/**
 * Milestone 34 — a refusal that tells the caller when to come back says so in
 * its body too. Closes B-44.
 *
 * **Measured first**, on `main` at `cdc09ce`, before a line of this was
 * written: every refusal CORE can produce, swept by driving all 52
 * registrations anonymously, driving all 52 again with a credential and a body
 * they reject, and racing the five-way concurrent keyed write from milestone
 * 33. **105 refusals.** 53 `invalid_request` and 48 `unauthenticated`, all
 * `retryable: false` with no `retry-after` — the flag and the header agree.
 * **4 `conflict`, all carrying `retry-after: 1` while reporting
 * `retryable: false`**, and those four were the only contradictions in the
 * sweep. Against `rate_limited`, which gets it right, the rule CORE already
 * followed everywhere else was plain:
 *
 *     a refusal carries `retry-after` if and only if its body says
 *     `retryable: true`
 *
 * The cause was structural. `retryable` came from a set of error codes in
 * `errors.ts`; `retry-after` was written by hand in two unrelated places
 * (`rateLimitHeaders` and a `IN_FLIGHT_HEADERS` constant in `retry.ts`). Two
 * independent statements about one fact, and nothing made them agree.
 *
 * What this gate holds, on both backends:
 *
 *  1. **The biconditional, over the whole surface.** Every refusal reachable
 *     from every registration: `retry-after` present ⇔ `retryable: true`.
 *
 *     Its limit, measured rather than assumed and reported in
 *     `docs/refusal-retryability.md`: this case **does not catch B-44 being
 *     restored**. Every refusal the sweep reaches is `invalid_request` or
 *     `unauthenticated`, neither of which states a time, so the biconditional
 *     holds vacuously however `retryable` is derived. It is a guard against a
 *     refusal added *later* with a time and a stale flag — which is how B-44
 *     would come back — and it is not what proves today's behaviour. The cases
 *     below are.
 *  2. **The four refusals that were wrong are right**, named rather than
 *     counted: an in-flight twin is `409`, `retryable: true`, `retry-after: 1`.
 *  3. **The refusals that were right are unchanged**: a reuse is `409`,
 *     `retryable: false`, no header; a rate-limited caller is `429`,
 *     `retryable: true`, and its `retry-after` still matches the window and
 *     still agrees with `details.retry_after_ms`.
 *  4. **One field, not two.** `CoreError` renders both from
 *     `retryAfterSeconds`, refuses a time that is not a whole second of at
 *     least one, and leaves a code-retryable refusal (`unavailable`,
 *     `internal`) retryable without inventing a time for it.
