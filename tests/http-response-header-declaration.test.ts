/**
 * Every response declares the headers it sets, and every response carries the one
 * a caller cannot work without — milestone 28.
 *
 * The four surfaces before this one are declared and gated: the query string
 * (24), the body (25), the request headers (26) and the answer's status, content
 * type and body (27). Milestone 27's own record says in as many words that it
 * makes no claim about response **headers**. This is that claim, and the two
 * defects it found are both on the paths a caller reaches when something has
 * already gone wrong — measured on `main` at `ea793f3`, before anything was
 * changed:
 *
 *  1. **An unmatched route answered `404` with no headers at all.** The body
 *     carried `correlation_id`; the header a caller reads it from was absent, on
 *     the one answer it gets when it cannot reach any route in CORE.
 *  2. **An unparseable JSON body answered `400` from the Node adapter** with
 *     `{code, message}` — no `correlation_id`, no `details`, no `retryable`, no
 *     header — so the one refusal produced above the router was the one refusal
 *     that was not the documented `Error`.
 *
 * And two things that were true but undeclared: `x-correlation-id` was set on 52
 * of 52 responses and documented on none of them, and the three `x-ratelimit-*`
 * headers were sent on **every** limited response, successes included, while the
 * contract documented them only on the shared `RateLimited` 429 — as if a caller
 * could only learn its budget by exceeding it.
 *
 * What this file asserts, all of it measured against real answers rather than
 * read out of the router:
 *
 *  1. The declaration is well formed: lower-case unique names, anchored shapes, a
 *     reason each.
 *  2. Every one of the 52 operations answers with `x-correlation-id`, it matches
 *     the declared shape, and it equals the `correlation_id` in the body whenever
 *     the body carries one — the two must be the same fact.
 *  3. No response carries a header that is not declared, and the router cannot
 *     send one: `sealHeaders` refuses it.
 *  4. The contract documents, for the status each operation actually returns,
 *     exactly the headers CORE sets on it when a limiter is wired.
 *  5. The paths that had no headers now have them: the unmatched 404, the
 *     malformed-header 400, the unparseable-body 400 over a real socket, and an
 *     unhandled exception's 500.
 *  6. With a limiter wired, the rate-limit headers are on a success too, they are
 *     consistent with each other, and `retry-after` appears on the 429 and
 *     nowhere else.
