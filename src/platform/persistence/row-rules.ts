/**
 * The schema's `CHECK` constraints, restated once, for the reference backend.
 *
 * Every port has two implementations and the suite runs against both. That is
 * only evidence if a row Postgres refuses is also refused in memory — otherwise
 * a green reference-store run certifies a bug instead of catching it, which is
 * the failure B-12 names. The uniqueness cycle closed that for uniqueness. This
 * file closes it for the 100 `CHECK` constraints the schema declares.
 *
 * Restated **once**, in a table, rather than sprinkled through the stores:
 * twenty-odd closed vocabularies written out at each write site would be twenty
 * copies of one truth, and the copies would drift. A store calls `assertRow`
 * and gets every rule for its table.
 *
 * The rules are not derived from the live schema, because the point of the
 * reference backend is to run with no database. They are kept honest three ways
 * instead: `tests/check-parity.test.ts` probes each rule against both backends,
 * the same file fails when the schema declares a `CHECK` no case covers, and the
 * vocabularies here are asserted equal to the domain unions in both directions
 * at typecheck time, so drift is a compile error rather than a silent gap.
