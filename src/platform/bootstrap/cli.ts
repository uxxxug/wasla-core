/**
 * Operator surface for provisioning a credential.
 *
 * A CLI for the same reason replay is one, and for a stronger one: this is the
 * path that exists *because* `POST /v1/sessions` now refuses a caller holding
 * nothing. An HTTP route that provisions the first credential would be the hole
 * milestone 31 closed, wearing a different name. What this command needs is
 * database access, which is strictly more than the ability to send a request,
 * and which anybody who could run it already has.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL=… npm run bootstrap:credential -- \
 *     --service-name market --organization <organization_id> [--roles service]
 *
 * `--roles` defaults to `service`, which is what a channel adapter needs:
 * `session.issue` to obtain sessions for the people it authenticated on its own
 * channel, plus `events.submit`, `fulfillment.request`, `fulfillment.read` and
 * `identity.read`. `platform_admin` has to be asked for explicitly, because the
 * default of a provisioning command must be the weaker credential.
 *
 * The token is written to stdout once, inside the JSON report, and cannot be
 * recovered afterwards: only its hash is stored. Re-running the command mints a
 * new session rather than reprinting the old one.
