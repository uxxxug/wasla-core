/**
 * The response headers CORE sets, and the shape each one is sent in.
 *
 * The answer side's last undeclared surface. Milestone 26 closed the headers
 * CORE **reads** (`headers.ts`); milestone 27 closed the status, the content type
 * and the body it **answers** with, and said so explicitly in its own record:
 * it made no claim about response headers. This module is that claim.
 *
 * Measured on `main` at `ea793f3`, by driving all 52 operations through the real
 * router and reading the answers rather than the code:
 *
 *   x-correlation-id            set on 52 of 52 responses, documented on 0
 *   x-ratelimit-limit/remaining/reset
 *                               set on every *limited* response — successes and
 *                               refusals alike — documented only on the shared
 *                               `RateLimited` 429, as if they were a refusal
 *                               feature
 *   retry-after                 429 only, documented there
 *   content-type                set by one route (`/metrics`), which is the only
 *                               response in CORE that is not JSON
 *
 * and two defects, both on the paths a caller reaches when something is already
 * wrong:
 *
 *   - **An unmatched route answered `404` with no headers at all.** The body
 *     carried `correlation_id`, every other answer carried the header, and the
 *     one response a caller gets when it cannot reach CORE at all was the one it
 *     could not quote back. The `if (!matched)` branch simply returned no
 *     `headers` key.
 *   - **An unparseable JSON body answered `400` from the Node adapter**, above
 *     the router, with `{code, message}` and no `correlation_id`, no `details`
 *     and no `retryable` — not the `Error` shape milestone 27 made every
 *     documented refusal use, and with no correlation id anywhere in it.
 *
 * The fix is structural rather than per-site: every answer leaves through
 * `sealHeaders`, which is the only place in CORE that decides what a response
 * header may be. It refuses a name that is not declared here, and refuses a
 * value that does not match the declared shape — so a header CORE sets and has
 * not documented is a 500 in a test rather than an undocumented field in
 * production. That direction is deliberate: an undeclared *request* header must
 * be ignored, because proxies add their own and refusing them would refuse
 * ordinary traffic (`headers.ts` records that asymmetry), but an undeclared
 * *response* header is CORE's own doing and nobody else's, so there is nothing to
 * be tolerant of.
 *
 * Milestone 32 added the seventh declaration, `idempotent-replay`, which is the
 * first header whose presence is a fact about one call rather than about the
 * route or the deployment: it marks an answer the router replayed from a
 * recorded one instead of running the handler again.
