/**
 * The request headers CORE reads, and the shape each one is accepted in.
 *
 * The third and last request surface. Milestone 24 closed the query string and
 * milestone 25 closed the body; both had the same defect and the same fix — the
 * route declares what it accepts, the router refuses the rest, and the handler
 * cannot reach what was not declared. Headers are the surface where that
 * argument was weakest and the consequence largest, because a header is the only
 * part of the request CORE **stores as its own record of what happened**.
 *
 * Measured on `main` at `a043ab7`, through `createServer(router.nodeListener())`
 * and a raw socket rather than through the test harness:
 *
 *   x-correlation-id: <8000 characters>   → 200, echoed and recorded in full
 *   x-correlation-id: "   "               → 200, "   " is the identity of record
 *   x-correlation-id: "a\tb"              → 200, accepted
 *   x-correlation-id: a  (twice)          → 200, recorded as "a, b"
 *
 * `correlation_id` is a `text` column on audit, outbox, ledger, inbound-event,
 * notification and subscription rows, and it is the field every reconciliation
 * and audit read traces a request by. So the old rule — *any* non-empty string,
 * taken verbatim — meant a caller could write kilobytes of chosen text into the
 * audit trail with every ordinary request, that two unrelated requests could
 * both be traced by `"   "`, and that a repeated header became one id belonging
 * to neither half. `bearer()` had the matching flaw in the other direction: a
 * repeated `authorization` was silently narrowed to `[0]`, so CORE chose which
 * of two credentials to authenticate.
 *
 * Three deliberate differences from the query string and the body:
 *
 *   - **An undeclared header is not refused.** HTTP requires unknown headers to
 *     be ignored, and every proxy, browser and load balancer adds its own; a
 *     router that refused them would refuse ordinary traffic. What the gate
 *     enforces instead is that CORE never *reads* a header it has not declared —
 *     the half of the rule that is actually about CORE's behaviour.
 *   - **A malformed declared header is refused before the rate limiter**, not
 *     after. The limiter derives its subject from `authorization` and the
 *     forwarding headers, so it cannot run before those values are known to be
 *     single and bounded. The refusal costs a length check and one regular
 *     expression, touches no store, and is the cheapest work in the request.
 *   - **A refusal cannot echo the header that caused it.** The response carries a
 *     freshly generated correlation id, and the refusal says the header was
 *     rejected. Echoing an 8000-character value back to prove it was too long
 *     would be the defect answering itself.
