  // Replaying history is separate from submitting an event, and much stronger:
  // it can re-drive consumers over facts from months ago and, in `reapply` mode,
  // ask handlers to act on them again. `events.submit` is held by every service
  // caller, so reusing it would have handed MARKET and MOVE the ability to
  // replay CORE's history. It is granted to `platform_admin` alone.
  | "events.replay"
  // Reviving a dead `outbox` or `event_delivery` row (B-27). Its own permission
  // rather than a reuse of `events.replay`, because the two reach different
  // systems: a replay re-drives CORE's own consumers, while a revival causes a
  // signed POST to leave the building for a partner's webhook. Also
  // `platform_admin` only, so neither MARKET nor MOVE can decide on CORE's behalf
  // that a dead-lettered event should be sent after all.
  | "events.revive"
  // Plans and their prices are operator territory; reading a subscription is
  // not. Split into two so a tenant can see what it is paying for without
  // also being able to publish a plan or collect a charge. The names are
  // CORE's own capabilities, not product features — a plan's `feature_key` is
  // opaque data and never becomes a permission (ADR 0018).
  | "subscription.read"
  | "subscription.write"
  // Reading a subject's standing and the signals behind it (ADR 0015). One
  // permission, not two: there is no route that writes a signal, because
  // signals arrive as events from the systems that observed them, so a
  // `reputation.write` permission would guard nothing and would advertise a
  // capability CORE does not have.
  | "reputation.read"
  // Minting a session for a principal, which is not "acting on behalf of" that
  // principal — it **is** that principal: the token the route returns carries
  // every role and permission its memberships give it, and CORE cannot tell it
  // apart from one the principal obtained itself. So this is the strongest
  // permission in the list, and deliberately not implied by `identity.write`:
  // editing an identity's display name and being able to become it are not the
  // same power, and a role that needs the first must not silently get the
  // second. Held by `platform_admin` and by `service` — a channel adapter
  // exists to obtain sessions for the people it speaks to — and by nothing
  // else. Before milestone 31 the route that consumes this required no
  // credential at all (B-39).
