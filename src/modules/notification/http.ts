 * is no `/pending`, `/failed` or `/retrying` endpoint: those are the same
 * question with a different filter, and a separate path per status is how one
 * concept ends up with five sources of truth that drift.
 *
 * Nothing here duplicates `/v1/event-deliveries/undelivered`. That answers "has
 * a subscribing system received this event"; these answer "has a person been
 * told". Folding them together would report a webhook as if it were a message
